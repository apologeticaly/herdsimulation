# Herd Simulation
This project was completed for the CS 1.1 course at Makeschool. The simulation is class based, with viruses, immunity and hosts randomly generated for each simulation. 


## How to Use
```
python3 simulation.py {pop_size} {vacc_percentage} {virus_name} {mort_rate} {repo_rate}
```
Example output:
```
a .txt file with a log of all deaths and how much of the population died.
```
