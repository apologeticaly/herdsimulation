1) What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
    Pop: 100000     Vax%: 0.90      Virus: Ebola    Mortality: 0.70 Spread: 0.25    Initial Infected: 10
2) What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
    10%
3) What percentage of the population died from the virus?
    5%
4) Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?
    One of of every 10.
